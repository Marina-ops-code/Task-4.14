## git init

**git init** - Running ***git init*** in an existing repository is safe. It will not overwrite things that are already there. The primary reason for rerunning ***git init*** is to pick up newly added templates (or to move the repository to another place if **--separate-git-dir** is given).


```bash=
git init .
```
