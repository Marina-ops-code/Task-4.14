## git merge

**git merge** - The ***merge*** command is used to integrate changes from another branch. The target of this integration (i.e. the branch that receives changes) is always the currently checked out HEAD branch. While Git can perform most integrations automatically, some changes will result in conflicts that have to be solved by the user.


```bash=
git merge .
```
