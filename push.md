## git push

**git push** The "***push***" command is used to publish new local commits on a remote server. The source (i.e. which branch the data should be uploaded from) is always the currently checked out HEAD branch. The target (i.e. which branch the data should be uploaded to) can be specified in the command's options.



```bash=
git push .
```
