## git status

**git status** - ***Git status*** command is used in Git to know the status of the working tree. It shows the state of your working directory and helps you see all the files which are untracked by ***Git***, staged or unstaged. In shorter terms, ***Git*** will show you any difference in the current tree and the HEAD pointer (Refer ***Git*** Terminologies).


```bash=
git status .
```
