## git clone ## 

**git clone** - Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository (visible using _git branch --remotes_ ), and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repositoryâ€™s currently active branch.

git clone .
```
